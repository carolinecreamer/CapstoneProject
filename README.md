User Personas
- Anna is a senior in college and is applying to jobs all over the country. She has only ever lived in the Midwest and is looking to try something new, but she is struggling to figure out the best city to move to based on where she can afford with her projected salary range and where she will have friends to make the adjustment easier. She typically uses her phone to do research and is easily offput by web applications that aren't responsive in design.
- Robert is a father of two who is looking to move out of Chicago, but he doesn't know exactly where he wants to go. He is deciding between Nashville, Boulder, and San Francisco and wants to decide based on where his kids will have the best quality of life based on the cost of living in the area. He mostly uses his computer to do research. He is familiar with technology, but is not particularly savvy when it comes to interacting with the internet and needs information presented very clearly and simply. 
- Richard is going on sabbatical and is going to rent his two bedroom apartment. He has never rented out his property before and wants to see what rent prices are in his area for other two-bedroom properties in order to help him settle on a reasonable rent price. He typically interacts with web applications on his laptop and is not particularly technologically savvy.
